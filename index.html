							<h2>Northwestern CTEC Scores Trend Analyzer</h2>

						</header>
						<h3>By: Michael Wang and Ted Wu </h3>

						We built a CTEC Scores predictor to analyze students' feedback about Northwestern professors. We are aiming to utilize data analytics to improve the ultimate Northwestern student experience.

							<p>Our objective is to use machine learning to train more than 10,000 examples scraped directly from our course and teacher evaluation website in order to analyze
								many different attributes to analyze the trends and to predict the probability of a professor getting a CTEC score above a 5. </p>

									<p id ='problem'><strong>The Problem</strong></br> We were interested in seeing how we could use the power of machine learning to sift through CTECs. Currently, there is an enormous corpus of data from CTECs, which include review scores, actual reviews, and metadata. We hope that by using the correct machine learning algorithms, we can spot trends predicative of high CTEC scores.</p></br>
									<p id ='solution'><strong>Solution </strong> </br>Our attributes come from a bag of words of size 1000, where half the words comprise the most common words found in CTECs, and the other half comprise names of professors. Our input is a list of 1000 attributes, where the value is 1 if it exists and 0 otherwise. For our learner, we used a Bayesian Logistic Regression algorithm. We got the best result from this, likely because this learner works well for problems involving bags of words and situations where each attribute may or may not contribute a small amount in predicting the final output (but many attributes may be accurate in aggregate).</p></br>

									<p id ='methods'><strong>TESTING AND TRAINING </strong> </br>	We tested and trained our data using Weka. Using a data scraper created by another classmate, Al Johri, we scraped Northwestern’s CTEC database for all CTECs related to the EECS department. We used that data to create a dictionary mapping to the aforementioned bag of words, and used that to generate a bag for each CTEC, outputting our final results in Weka’s ARFF format. Our “class” was whether or not the instructor score for the CTEC was above or below a 5 (we will elaborate more on that later). Finally, we used Weka to try different algorithms until we found one that worked the best. We measured our success in terms of maximizing accuracy and f-score, using the ZeroR classifier as a baseline.</p></br>

									<p id ='results'><strong> PRELIMINARY RESULTS </strong></br></br>Our final classifier had both an accuracy and f-score of 77.7%, which is not too bad compared to our ZeroR baseline accuracy of 55%. Furthermore, we were able to create a list of words and Professor names, as well as their correlations with higher CTEC scores (both positive and negative). Although this is far from conclusive, we believe that a critical analysis of our results will show that this warrants a more detailed look.</p></br>
